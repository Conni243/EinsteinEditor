If you want to re-create the multi-size ico file, I highly recommend
https://redketchup.io/icon-editor

When creating releases, don't include the /icons/ folder, just because its contents are never used.
I just wanted to keep the original .pngs around just in case they're needed for some reason.

The current icons were made in good old MS Paint.
The font for the E is Rage Italic.
A font I would have slightly preferred but not enough to go changing all of the icons is Book Script MT. So if you're re-doing the icons anyway, please use that font instead!

An artful way to edit your bibite's brains!

To download and use:
 [TODO: how to let people download and use it, and give them instructions, whenever I figure that out]

 -----

What this can do right now:
 - Show a menu with options for input neurons, output neurons, and adding a hidden neuron
     - For input neurons, show a single neuron icon
	 - For output neurons, show a single neuron icon
	 - For adding a hidden neuron, show icons with all 8 distinct neuron types
 - Have the window be resized without hiding menu neuron icons (short of microscopic sizes)
 - (Maybe) crash or break in some other spectacular fashion (In other words: I make no guarantees about the condition of this software.)

What this will do (planned features):
 - Show/Hide input and output Neurons
 - Add/Remove hidden neurons (of specified types)
 - Add/Remove Synapses
 - View types and descriptions of neurons
 - View synapse strengths
 - Drag neurons around the screen
 - Load brain from a bibite file
 - Save brain to a bibite file
 - Allow you to create small, weak, inefficient, and dumb bibites to fill your empty worlds
 
What this might do (ideas for the future):
 - Create a blank bibite
 - Have keyboard shortcuts
 - Edit neuron type
 - Get some sort of visual indicator of the flow of any arbitrary input combination? Or allow testing certain input values?
 - Zoom in/out
 - Auto-arrange neurons in a prettier and more clean arrangement
 - Look pretty
 - Sentience

What this can't do (and probably never will):
 - Edit genes
 - Edit world files
 - Make you a milkshake

For any potential contributors:
 - I've been using Visual Studio 2019 for an IDE, so if you run into problems with another IDE, try using VS 2019 instead.
 - This uses the phi graphics "library"/framework/whatever thing, which is a separate project I partnered in creating a few years ago. It has its own repository (https://github.com/quaris628/PhiGraphicsEngine), so if you spot any issues with or want to contribute to any of the code in the 'phi' folder, go to that repo instead of this one to write up an issue or pull request (or whatever).
 - I want to talk with you about what you're doing! (If it hasn't been years and years.) Email me at quaris314@gmail.com or message me on reddit at u/quaris628.

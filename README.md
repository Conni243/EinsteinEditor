An artful way to edit your bibite's brains!

To download and use:
 [TODO: how to let people download and use it, and give them instructions, whenever I figure that out]

 -----

What this can do:
 - (Maybe) crash or break in some other spectacular fashion
 - Show a menu with options for input neurons, output neurons, and hidden neurons
     - Selecting each button shows an appropriate list of neuron icons
 - Show neurons as circular icons, with their type as a picture, and description as text below the circle
 - Have the window be resized without hiding menu neuron icons (short of microscopic sizes)

What this can't do (and probably never will):
 - Make you a milkshake
 - Edit genes
 - Edit world files

What this will do (planned features):
 - Allow you to create small, weak, inefficient, and dumb bibites to fill your empty worlds
 - Show/Hide input and output Neurons
 - Add/Remove hidden neurons (of specified types)
 - Add/Remove Synapses
 - View types and descriptions of neurons in the brain
 - View synapse strengths
 - Drag neurons around the screen
 - Load brain from a bibite file
 - Save brain to a bibite file
 
What this might do (ideas for the future):
 - Sentience
 - Create a blank bibite
 - Have keyboard shortcuts
 - Edit neuron type
 - Get some sort of visual indicator of the flow of any arbitrary input combination? Or allow testing certain input values?
 - Zoom in/out
 - Have a button to auto-arrange neurons in a prettier and more clean arrangement
 - Look pretty

For any potential contributors:
 - I've been using Visual Studio 2019 for an IDE, so if you run into problems with another IDE, try using VS 2019 instead.
 - This uses the phi graphics "library"/framework/whatever thing, which is a separate project I partnered in creating a few years ago. It has its own repository (https://github.com/quaris628/PhiGraphicsEngine), so if you spot any issues with or want to contribute to any of the code in the 'phi' folder, go to that repo instead of this one to write up an issue or pull request (or whatever).
 - I want to talk with you about what you're doing! (If it hasn't been years and years.) Email me at quaris314@gmail.com or message me on reddit at u/quaris628.

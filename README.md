# EinsteinEditor
An artful way to edit your bibite's brains!

To download and use:
 [TODO: how to let people download and use it, and give them instructions, whenever I figure that out]

 -----

What this can do:
 - (Maybe) crash or break in some other spectacular fashion
 - Show input and output neurons in the brain editor area
 - Show a non-functional menu for adding hidden neurons
 - Display neurons as circles, with their type as an icon inside the circle, and description as text below the circle
 - Drag neurons around the screen
 - Have the window be resized without hiding menu neuron icons (short of microscopic sizes)

What this can't do (and probably never will):
 - Make you a milkshake
 - Edit genes
 - Edit world files

What this will do (planned features):
 - Allow you to create small, weak, inefficient, and dumb bibites to fill your empty worlds
 - Hide input and output Neurons
 - Add/Remove hidden neurons (of specified types)
 - Add/Remove Synapses
 - View types and descriptions of neurons in the brain
 - View synapse strengths
 - Load brain from a bibite file
 - Save brain to a bibite file
 
What this might do (ideas for the future):
 - Sentience
 - Create a blank bibite
 - Have keyboard shortcuts
 - Have a button to auto-arrange neurons in a prettier and more clean arrangement
 - When neurons are added, have their spawn location staggered
 - Get some sort of visual indicator of the flow of any arbitrary input combination? Or allow testing certain input values?
 - Edit neuron type
 - Zoom in/out
 - Look pretty

For any potential contributors:
 - I've been using Visual Studio 2019 for an IDE, so if you run into problems with another IDE, I'd try VS 2019 as a workaround.
 - This uses the phi graphics "library"/framework/whatever thing, which is a separate project I partnered in creating a few years ago. It has its own repository (https://github.com/quaris628/PhiGraphicsEngine), so if you spot any issues with or want to contribute to any of the code in the 'phi' folder, also go to that repo to write up an issue or pull request (or whatever). If you don't, I'll still try to keep the two in sync, it would just mean a little more work for me.
 - I want to talk with you about what you want to work on! (If it hasn't been too long since I wrote this, anyway.) You can email me at quaris314@gmail.com or message me on reddit at u/quaris628.

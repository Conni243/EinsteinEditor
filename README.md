# EinsteinEditor
An artful way to edit your bibite's brains!

To download and use:
 [TODO: how to let people download and use it, and give them instructions, whenever I figure that out]

 -----

What this can do:
 - (Maybe) crash or break in some other spectacular fashion
 - Show/Hide input and output neurons in the brain editor area
 - Show a non-functional menu for adding hidden neurons
 - Add/Remove Synapses
 - View types and descriptions of neurons in the brain

 - Drag neurons around the brain editor area
 - Support window resizing

What this can't do (and probably never will):
 - Make you a milkshake
 - Edit genes
 - Edit world files

What this will do (planned features):
 - Allow you to create small, weak, inefficient, and dumb bibites to fill your empty worlds
 - Add/Remove hidden neurons (of specified types)
 - Set and View synapse strengths
 - Load brain from a bibite file
 - Save brain to a bibite file
 
What this might do (ideas for the future):
 - Sentience
 - Create a blank bibite
 - Keyboard shortcuts
 - A button to auto-arrange neurons in a prettier and more clean arrangement
 - When neurons are added, have their spawn location staggered
 - Get some sort of visual indicator of the flow of any arbitrary input combination? Or allow testing certain input values?
 - Edit neuron type
 - Zoom in/out
 - Look pretty (?)

For any potential contributors:
 - I want to talk with you about what you want to work on! (If it hasn't been too long since I wrote this, anyway.) You can message me on reddit at u/quaris628, or email me at quaris314@gmail.com.
 - I've been using Visual Studio 2019 for an IDE, so if you run into problems with another IDE, I'd try VS 2019 as a workaround.
 - This uses the phi graphics "library"/framework/whatever thing, which is a separate project I partnered in creating a few years ago. It has its own repository (https://github.com/quaris628/PhiGraphicsEngine), so if you spot any issues with or want to contribute to any of the code in the 'phi' folder, also go to that repo to write up an issue or pull request (or whatever). If you don't, I'll still try to keep the two in sync, it would just mean a little more work for me. [Edit: Given how many small fixes and enhancements I've been making, I'm just giving up on keeping the other repo in sync. I'll do a larger sync sometime in the future.]
